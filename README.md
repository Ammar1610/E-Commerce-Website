This project report presents a Python-based e-commerce web application with Django as the main technological stack, specifically designed for the fashion industry. The purpose of the programme is to give fashion fans access to a comprehensive online shopping platform.

E-commerce is rapidly emerging as a recognised and practical business model. An increasing number of businesses are setting up websites that allow them to transact business online. One could reasonably say that internet purchasing has become commonplace. This project aims to establish an online fashion store where consumers may purchase shoes, clothes, and other products while kicking back at home. It makes sense that when a customer can access the item's details online and discover it on the retailer's website, they will find the item to be more captivating and alluring. 

## Django Framework

Django is an open-source, free online application framework based in the Python programming language. It is a Python web application framework. Its foundation is the Model-View-Template (MVT) design pattern. These days, the Django web application framework is in high demand because it is incredibly fast and provides you with predefined library functions that make your work easier. In other words, it is a collection of components that make it easier and faster for you to develop web applications. 

### Django MVT

Django serves as an open-source Python web application framework based on the Model View Template (MVT) paradigm. It's a build pattern for software. Model, View, and Template are the three components that make up Django MVT.
The Model is used to take care of the database. The Model are the data access layers which handle the data. 
The Templates handles the User Interface part. It is a presentation layer. When we make any database, the database which is shown on the screen is a template. 
The View is utilized to execute the business rationale or logic. When a user interacts with the Django then Django sends the resources to URL and URL maps the view which interacts with a model to take the data and render the templates.
